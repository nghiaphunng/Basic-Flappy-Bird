# [PYTHON] BASIC FLAPPY BIRD

## Introduction
* Have you heard of a game called Flappy Bird ? It's a game with a simple yet challenging gameplay. When I was young, I used to play it on my parents' phone, so I wanted to try playing it again by writing my own code.

* I named it **Basic Flappy Bird** because it's the game I wrote with just squares, rectangles, no sound, and everything is very simple.
